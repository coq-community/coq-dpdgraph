## Indications for the preparation of successive releases

The branch `coq-master` is monitored by Coq continuous integration, so that
the Coq developers help making sure that the code of this Coq plugin is
compatible with the master branch of the Coq development.

Every Coq release, it is necessary to produce a tagged version of this package
so that this version can then be distributed with coq-platform.

There are only few operations to perform, thanks to the coq-community templates.

 - First create a branch for this new release.  For instance, for version 8.14
   of Coq, the branch `coq-v8.14` was created.

 - Edit file `meta.yml`  To know what modifications should be performed, the
   best is to compare versions of `meta.yml` for branch `coq-master` and the
   latest branch for a coq release.

 - Edit file `configure.ac` Here again, the modifications should be
   similar to modification from branch `coq-master` to the latest
   branch for a coq release.

 - run the following commands:
 ```bash
   autoconf
   ./configure
   make distrib
```

   This creates a tar-gz arthive with the right naming.

 - on github, create a new release for this version.  The name is
   usually composed of two parts.  The first part is the revision for
   coq-dpdgraph (as used in the `coq-master` version of
   `configure.ac`), then the + sign, then the targeted revision of coq.

   The archive that was generated by `make distrib` should be added to
   that release (as an asset).

 - The next step is to add an opam file for this revision in
   `opam-coq-archive`.

 - Clone the `opam-coq-archive` repository, create a working branch
   stemming from `master`, and then add the new opam file at the
   relevant place.

 - If the targeted revision of Coq is already
   official, then this opam file can be added directly in the
   `released` directory.  The name of the directory for this file
   should be the similar to the name of the tag
   (`v` being replace by `coq-dpdgraph.`).  The opam file should be
   inspired from the opam file for the previous revision except that
   the url src and checksum should be adapted to the new name and its
   checksum (obtained using `sha512sum

 - If you want to test that you new `opam` file is correct, a first
   step is to call `opam lint` on this file.  The second step is to
   test an installation.  Here is a way to do it quickly:

```bash
      opam repo add .../opam-coq-archive/released
      opam install coq-dpdgraph
```
